					<p>The design of slope angles is influenced by:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Geologic structure</li>
						<li>Rock strength</li>
						<li>Hydrogeology</li>
						<li>Ore distribution</li>
						<li>Operational considerations</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Generally, the most critical factor in slope stability is the orientation of geologic structure relative to the pit wall and the resulting maximum attainable bench-face angles and catch-bench widths. Rock discontinuities such as joint sets, faults, lithologic contacts, and bedding planes, may form plane shear failures on a bench scale or multiple-bench scale if they daylight at a critical orientation in the pit slopes. Combinations of discontinuity sets may form wedge, step path, planar, or circular failure geometries on a bench scale or multiple-bench scale. Interramp and overall slope stability are verified by assessing the impact of major faults and structures on slope stability.</p>
