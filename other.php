					<h2>Geomechanical and Soils Testing Laboratory</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>CNI provides a complete geotechnical testing laboratory capable of performing soil and rock testing in support of engineering programs. The laboratory is staffed by five full-time personnel with over a combined 35 years’ worth of experience in soil and rock testing. CNI’s nonproduction laboratory allows for our engineers to work hand-in-hand with our laboratory technicians to ensure testing programs are uniquely catered to each engineering program and testing results are of the highest quality.</p>
					<p>Having our laboratory close-at-hand allows immediate feedback and strong communication between engineer and laboratory technician. Unique samples that many other laboratories would simply discard, due to complicated preparations, are prepared and tested by our laboratory under the scrutiny of our engineers to ensure the time and money spent to obtain those samples is rewarded with first-class data.</p>
					<p>Our laboratory is equipped with fully automated testing devices. Testing is performed in accordance with the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), the International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM), and the British Standards (BS). Our laboratory also has a United States Department of Agriculture soil permit required in order to import foreign soils for testing purposes.</p>

					<h2>Borehole Instrumentation Installation</h2>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>CNI uses the continuous solid fiberglass rod method to accurately install
instrumentation such as Vibrating Wire Piezometers (VWP) and Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) cables in boreholes of any inclination from vertical to horizontal.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>21400 pound (9500 kg) breaking strength carrier medium is used to secure the instrumentation</li>
						<li>Vibrating Wire Extensometers (VWP) Time Domain Reflectometers (TDR) or any other “down the hole” instrumentation can be installed at the required depth</li>
						<li>Installation ability as deep as 5000 feet (1524 m)</li>
						<li>Substantial safer procedure than the alternatives due to high breaking strength of carrier rod, reduced material handling and absence of joints</li>
