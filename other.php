					<h2>Geomechanical Rock and Soils Testing Laboratory</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>CNI provides a complete geotechnical testing laboratory capable of performing soil and rock testing in support of engineering programs. The laboratory is staffed by five full-time personnel with over a combined 35 years’ worth of experience in soil and rock testing. CNI’s nonproduction laboratory allows for our engineers to work hand-in-hand with our laboratory technicians to ensure testing programs are uniquely catered to each engineering program and testing results are of the highest quality.</p>
					<p>Having our laboratory close-at-hand allows immediate feedback and strong communication between engineer and laboratory technician. Unique samples that many other laboratories would simply discard due to complicated preparations, are prepared and tested by our laboratory under the scrutiny of our engineers to ensure the time and money spent to obtain those samples is rewarded with first-class data.</p>
					<p>Our laboratory is equipped with fully automated testing devices. Testing is performed in accordance with the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), the International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM), and the British Standards (BS). Our laboratory also has a United States Department of Agriculture soil permit required in order to import foreign soils for testing purposes.</p>

					<h2>Vibrating-Wire Piezometer and TDR Cable Drill Hole Installations</h2>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>CNI utilizes a system of continuous solid fiberglass rod to precisely install instrumentation in boreholes of any inclination between vertical and horizontal. Installations can be done in any kind of drill hole.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A high-strength fiberglass rod is used to place sensors inside boreholes.</li>
						<li>Vibrating Wire Piezometers (VWP), Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) cable, or any other borehole instrumentation can be installed to the required depth</li>
						<li>Installation capability up to 5000 feet (1524 m) deep</li>
						<li>Rapid installation using the continuous carrier rod – over 1000 ft (328 m) per hour</li>
						<li>More reliable than other methods due to the high tensile strength of the carrier rod, reduced material handling, and absence of joints</li>
						<li>Install capabilities in conventional rotary, RC, and NQ or larger core holes</li>
